    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I am a Twenty year old Senior at UD, Born and raised in Nigeria but moved to Delaware in 2019. 
        I am easy to talk too as I have been referred to as "approachable".
        I love listening to Afrobeats and my favorite afrobeat musician is Wizkid(I recommend listening to his songs).
        My hobbies are watching and playing soccer as well as dancing.

        <ul> Some aspects of Web development I love are:
            <li>I get to be creative and implement my ideas on the site and make changes as needed</li>
            <li>I feel a sense of freedom while programming sites, I feel comfortable </li>
            
            
          </ul>
